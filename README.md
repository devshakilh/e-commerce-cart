### Common Issues

#### `ReactDOMTestUtils.act` is deprecated

To address the warning regarding `ReactDOMTestUtils.act` being deprecated, make sure to import `act` from `react` instead of `react-dom/test-utils` in your test files. Wrap your render calls in `act`.

Example:

```javascript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { act } from 'react';
import App from '../App';

test('renders App component', () => {
  act(() => {
    render(<App />);
  });
  
});
```
